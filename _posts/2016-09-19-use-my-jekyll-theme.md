If you want to use my website theme, follow the instructions and host it yourself. Easily setup as a Github page. To add pages (for example a portfolio, an extra about page, and so on), you need to link them to the `index.html` manually. Required to configure in this dimensions is a bit of html and jekyll know-how, read [the Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/). Other things are easy to edit and configure, even without much jekyll experience.
## 1. Get the sources

#### 1.1 Clone
Clone the repository from github:  
[https://github.com/lukas-h/lukas-h.github.io.git](https://github.com/lukas-h/lukas-h.github.io.git)  
Checkout the branch *theme*, by typing `git checkout theme`.

#### 1.2 download
Get the branch *theme* from my repository:  
[https://github.com/lukas-h/lukas-h.github.io/archive/theme.zip](https://github.com/lukas-h/lukas-h.github.io/archive/theme.zip)  

## 2. Configure
- Replace all the configuration in `_config.yml` and `_data/projects.yml` by your own data. Change the name, email address, configure your your language settings.  
And most important: change the site's URL!  

- Put your address and legal info into `imprint.html`.  

- Change the icon `images/favicon.png`.  

- Remove or edit the `CNAME` file that it does not point anymore to *himsel.me*.  

- Don't forget the `README.md`.  

## 3. Start writing posts
Replace the existing example post and then add your own!  
Have a look at the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
about how to write blog posts.  
To add tags to your posts, look into the example, you'll see that there is
a line starting with `tags:`. Add your keywords there. 

## 4. You're done
